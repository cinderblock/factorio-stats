# A Simple Factorio Server Status Webpage

This is a simple webpage that displays the status of a Factorio server.

It uses the Factorio server's RCON interface to get the server status and exposes it over an HTTP interface.

You must serve the compiled version of the ui folder with a web server.

The backend server must be started and configured with the correct RCON settings.
