    <h3>Space platforms</h3>

    <p>
      The backbone of planetary logistics and the first foray into space. Space platforms are flying factories that act
      as the means of transportation between planets.
    <ul>
      <li>Build defenses to shoot down incoming asteroids which threaten to smash your platform.</li>
      <li>Catch asteroid chunks, crush them and process them into thruster fuel and turret ammunition.</li>
      <li>Use the Platform hub and Cargo bays to shuttle cargo between planets.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Vulcanus</h3>

    <p>
      Blazing volcanic mountains, imposing geological landforms, plains blanketed in ash, and thick yellow sulfuric fog
      that burns your
      lungs and etches your eyes.
    <ul>
      <li>Extract and refine tough unbreakable Tungsten to craft big mining drills and foundries.</li>
      <li>Pull lava from the pits to produce an abundance of molten iron and copper.</li>
      <li>Research advanced metallurgic technologies to build an industrial forge-world.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Fulgora</h3>

    <p>
      A lifeless and desolate place. The thin air is freezing cold but bone dry. A distant sun twinkles in the dull
      purple of
      the sky. Wispy clouds race by as a gale whips up sand that grates against your armour.
    <ul>
      <li>Protect yourself from the nightly lightning storms, harness their unrelenting power for your own electricity
        needs.</li>
      <li>Reclaim the high-tech scraps and ruins of a long-forgotten civilization and recycle them into usable products.
      </li>
      <li>Unlock the advanced electromagnetic and superconducting powers of Holmium.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Gleba</h3>

    <p>
      A vibrant multi-coloured swampy landscape shrouded in a light mist. The air is thick and humid, carrying the
      muffled
      cries of unseen animals from far away.
    <ul>
      <li>Discover exotic plants, cultivate and harvest their fruits with Agriculture towers.</li>
      <li>Cook, crush, and process your produce before they rot and turn to spoilage.</li>
      <li>Venture into a new realm of biochemical engineering.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Aquilo</h3>

    <p>
      It's day, but stars still twinkle in the dark sky. You count the planet's sun among the stars, larger and brighter
      than
      the others, but still so dim you can barely feel its warmth at all. A howling wind chills you to the bone and
      gently
      rocks the iceberg you are sitting on.
    <ul>
      <li>Build heat pipes to keep your machines operational in the freezing cold.</li>
      <li>Extend your factory by building ice platforms.</li>
      <li>Unlock the power of cryogenic technologies and fusion power.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

      your rail networks.
